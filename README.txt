This program is an individual program only to sharpen the programing skills.
This program has no connection to Delhi Metro and it is only based on it(As I travel by it a lot ;-)).

How this program works -
1.It asks you to enter the source and destination names.
2.It then checks the details provided by you and if the details are found the it displays the result.
3.If details are not found then it compares first three characters of the station to avoid any possibility of misspelling etc and if first three characters matches then it will display the result otherwise it will display "No staions found".
4.The result it displays are
(a)Which metro to get on.
(b)Where to change metro (Ofcourse, if you have to change the metro).
(C)Which line color that metro station belong to (The one that you are in after changing the metro).
(D)Which metro to catch (On a station, metro trains are head in opposite direction i.e one is coming from station X whereas one is going to station X. This step ensures you have caught the right metro).
(E)Finally, it tells you where to deboard with total number of stations between them.
